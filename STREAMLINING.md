# Infra-Lab v1.7 Comprehensive Codebase Streamlining

This document outlines the changes made to streamline the Infra-Lab v1.7 codebase based on the critical review findings.

## Major Issues Addressed

### 1. Inconsistent File Structure & Code Location
- Fixed file structure to ensure Python modules are properly organized under src/process_lab/
- Updated entry points in pyproject.toml
- Removed redundant scripts/unified/process_lab.py

### 2. Duplicate Configuration/Template Files
- Removed duplicate templates directory
- Consolidated templates in src/process_lab/templates/
- Removed redundant config files
- Updated .gitignore to include generated files
- Updated config_gen.py to load templates from the correct location

### 3. NRDB Client Capabilities Enhancement
- Implemented cursor-based pagination in nrdb/client.py
- Updated functions to handle large datasets properly

### 4. Static Heuristics Refinement
- Improved the Keep-Ratio Heuristic to be more data-driven
- Enhanced the Cost Model to prioritize Histogram Layer when sufficient data exists
- Updated Risk Score calculation to query NRDB for current Tier-1 process prevalence

### 5. Fleet Helper Security Improvements
- Deprecated direct SSH mode in rollout.py
- Focused on safer deployment methods (print mode and ansible mode)

### 6. Minor Issues Fixed
- Clarified Visibility SLA measurement
- Simplified NRQL Pack handling
- Improved Confidence Score formula
- Integrated visualize.py into the CLI flow
- Fixed dependencies and imports
- Ensured correct entry points
