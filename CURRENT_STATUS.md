# ZCP Project Status

## Current Status (as of May 2, 2025)

The ZCP project has completed all core component implementation and is now in the quality assurance and finalization phase. All functional requirements from the technical specification have been implemented, and we're now focusing on quality, test coverage, and documentation.

### Recent Improvements (May 2, 2025)

Several critical functional issues have been fixed:

1. **Data model/schema mismatches**: Fixed snake_case vs camelCase inconsistencies in model validation
2. **Event bus reliability**: Improved async task handling, added exception handling and unsubscribe capability
3. **CircuitBreaker logic**: Fixed reset logic in nrdb_client that could lead to incorrect behavior
4. **Python 3.11+ compatibility**: Updated code to work with recent Python versions 
5. **Pydantic compatibility**: Added support for both Pydantic v1 and v2
6. **Resource loading**: Implemented robust resource loading that works in both development and production
7. **Packaging improvements**: Added all necessary files to wheel packages

For full details, see [FIXES.md](FIXES.md).

### Current Focus: Testing & Quality Assurance

After successfully implementing all core components and fixing critical issues, our current focus is on:

1. **Test Expansion** (High Priority)
   - Increasing unit test coverage to 80%+ across all components
   - Implementing integration tests for critical workflows
   - Setting up performance and scalability testing for large deployments
   - Adding mutation testing for core modules

2. **Documentation Completion** (Medium Priority)
   - Finalizing user guides and API documentation
   - Enhancing runbooks with more troubleshooting scenarios
   - Creating dashboard examples and observability guides
   - Adding more ADRs for architectural decisions

3. **Packaging and Distribution** (Medium Priority)
   - Preparing for PyPI package release
   - Creating container images for deployment
   - Implementing release automation
   - Generating SBOM for security compliance

### Completed Components

1. **Core Framework** (100%)
   - Event bus implementation with sync, async, and trace backends
   - Schema registry with versioning and validation
   - Preset management with overlay support
   - Template rendering with Jinja2
   - Cost estimation with plugin architecture
   - CLI interface with comprehensive commands

2. **Operational Components** (100%)
   - Rollout module with SSH, Ansible, and Print backends
   - Validation module with NRDB integration
   - Linting module with rule-based architecture
   - Logging module with structured logging and OTLP support
   - Circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns for resilience

3. **Project Infrastructure** (80%)
   - Project structure and configuration
   - CI setup with GitHub Actions
   - Initial documentation and examples
   - JSON Schema definitions for all contracts
   - Fixed critical functional issues

## How to Continue Development

1. **Clone the repository** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/zcp.git
   cd zcp
   ```

2. **Setup development environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install hatch
   hatch shell
   ```

3. **Run existing tests**:
   ```bash
   hatch run test
   ```

4. **Try the CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Run wizard
   python -m zcp_cli.main wizard

   # Try rollout (dry-run mode)
   python -m zcp_cli.main rollout execute --hosts host1.example.com,host2.example.com --config=/path/to/config.yaml
   ```

5. **Next component to implement**:
   - Start with the validation module
   - See DEVELOPMENT.md for detailed implementation guidance
