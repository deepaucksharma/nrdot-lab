# Project Streamlining Changes

This document summarizes the improvements made to streamline the New Relic ProcessSample Optimization Lab project.

## 1. Configuration System Improvements

### 1.1 Template-Based Configuration

- Created a unified template system (`newrelic-infra-template.yml`) to replace multiple similar configuration files
- Implemented a filter definitions file (`filter-definitions.yml`) to centralize filtering strategies
- Added scripts to generate configurations (`generate_config.sh` and `generate_config.ps1`)
- Enhanced filtering options with better categorization of system processes

**Benefits:**
- Reduced code duplication
- Simplified maintenance
- Made configurations more modular and easier to customize

### 1.2 Unified Docker Compose

- Created a single unified Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.unified.yml`) replacing:
  - `docker-compose.yml`
  - `docker-compose.override.yml`
  - `docker-compose.ci.yml`
- Implemented environment variables for all customizable options
- Added support for conditional volume mounting and service configurations

**Benefits:**
- Simplified deployment
- Reduced configuration files by 67%
- Improved configuration consistency

## 2. Script Consolidation

### 2.1 Unified Validation

- Created a single validation script (`validate.sh`) that replaces:
  - `validate_ingest.sh`
  - `validate_ingest_nojq.sh`
  - `validate_simple.sh`
  - `validate_ingest_windows.bat`
- Added PowerShell equivalent (`validate.ps1`) for Windows environments
- Implemented format options (text, JSON, CSV) for different use cases

**Benefits:**
- Reduced script count by 75%
- Added cross-platform compatibility
- Improved output formatting options

### 2.2 Visualization Enhancements

- Created unified visualization script (`visualize.py`) replacing:
  - `vis_latency.py`
  - `vis_latency_win.py`
  - `generate_visualization.py`
- Added support for multiple visualization types and output formats
- Improved data handling and presentation

**Benefits:**
- Consolidated visualization code
- Added more visualization options
- Improved output quality

## 3. Documentation Improvements

- Updated README with clearer instructions and more examples
- Added CHANGES.md to document improvements
- Consolidated and removed redundant license files
- Enhanced configuration documentation

**Benefits:**
- Better onboarding experience
- Clearer usage instructions
- Simplified maintenance documentation

## 4. Build and Deployment

- Updated Makefile with streamlined targets
- Added new convenience commands for common operations
- Improved scenario testing workflow
- Added generated config refresh capability

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive command structure
- Easier to run standard scenarios
- Simplified testing workflow

## 5. Code Quality and Efficiency

- Standardized code formatting and style
- Removed redundant script logic
- Enhanced error handling in scripts
- Improved platform detection for cross-platform compatibility

**Benefits:**
- More maintainable codebase
- More robust error handling
- Better cross-platform support

## Summary of Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Configuration Files | 9 | 3 | -67% |
| Shell Scripts | 14 | 6 | -57% |
| Duplicate Code | High | Low | Significant |
| Platform Support | Partial | Full | Enhanced |
| Docker Configuration Files | 3 | 1 | -67% |
| Documentation Files | Multiple | Consolidated | Improved clarity |

These changes significantly streamline the project, making it more maintainable and easier to use while preserving all functionality.
