# Strategic Roadmap: "Value-Driven Observability"

This roadmap outlines our multi-year plan for evolving the ProcessSample Optimization Lab into a comprehensive observability solution focused on business value.

## North Star Vision

> Every new byte we ingest returns ≥ 10× its cost in avoided revenue loss, faster MTTR, or engineering time saved.

## Current State

The current release establishes our baseline with:

- **Data Optimization**: 60s sampling and smart process filtering (~70% ingest reduction)
- **Validation**: Built-in tools to measure cost impact
- **Production-Ready**: Stable images and minimal resource requirements

## Strategic Plan

| Quarter     | Milestone                   | Key Features                                                | Outcomes                                     |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Q3 2025** | Maintenance                | Configuration refinements, expanded process filtering       | 75%+ ingest reduction with zero signal loss  |
| **Q4 2025** | Adaptive Sampler           | Dynamic rules API, hot-patch filters via GraphQL            | 15%+ additional ingest reduction            |
| **Q1 2026** | Business Context           | Service ontology, metrics-to-KPI mapping                    | Value dashboards for critical services       |
| **Q2 2026** | Predictive Operations      | ML models for anomaly detection                             | 30+ min warning for 70% of potential issues |
| **Q3 2026** | Actionable Intelligence    | Auto-route alerts, ticket creation, feedback loop           | 40% faster MTTR, 20% fewer unowned tickets  |
| **Q4 2026** | Autonomous Remediation     | Policy engine for automated actions                         | Sub-5 min MTTR for common issues            |

## Technical Workstreams

### Data Platform Evolution
- Smart gateway with dynamic rule capability
- Tiered storage with hot/cold data management

### Intelligence & Prediction
- Feature store for metrics aggregation
- MLOps pipeline for model training and deployment
- Insight generation based on historical patterns

### Business Context
- Service and team mapping repository
- KPI attribution framework
- Value quantification tools

## Success Metrics

Each release milestone includes specific success criteria:

- **Adaptive Sampler**: Dashboard latency within 5% of baseline while reducing ingest by 15%+
- **Business Context**: 95%+ correct KPI owner mapping for top business services
- **Predictive Operations**: ML model F1-score of 0.75+ on historical incidents
- **Actionable Intelligence**: MTTR reduction of 40%+ compared to baseline
- **Autonomous Remediation**: Successful auto-remediation in chaos testing scenarios
